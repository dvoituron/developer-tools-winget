# Developer Tools (winget)

This article lists all tools installed on my machine, using [WinGet](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) to simplify the installation.

## Prerequisites

  1. To install or update WinGet, go to the **Microsoft Store** 
     and install or update the [App Installer](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH4NNS1).
     
  2. To authorize installations from the Microsoft Store, you must be logged in (with a personal email address).
  
  3. Open a **Command Line** and run `winget` command to display the documentation.
